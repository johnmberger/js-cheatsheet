Last updated 07/14/2016

## Primitives

Primitives are the JavaScript building blocks.

- **Number**
  - Floating-point and integers
  - Also: Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN
- **Boolean**
  - `True` or `False`
- **String**
  - Represents textual data
- **Undefined**
  - Represents a value that hasn't been defined
- **Null**
  - Intentional absence of an object value
- **Symbol** (new in ES6)

## Variables

Variables are containers to store data (values).
They are shortcuts for storing data.

- Declared using `var`
- Naming: should be descriptive, should use CamelCase, can't start with number, can't have spaces, avoid symbols except `_`, `$`, `-`.

## Data Structures

- **Arrays**: ordered container for primitives (and other data structures), accessed via index
- **Objects**: unordered key/value pairs accessed via bracket or dot notation

## Programming Paradigms

- **Procedural**: JavaScript renders commands in order
- **Functional**:

## Flow Control

If statements

## Loops

## Operators

math, logical, comparison

## functions
-methods vs functions
## scope
## hoisting
## callbacks
## string concatenation
## computer science
- bigO
